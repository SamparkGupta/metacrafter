Project Title
MyToken

Simple Overview
MyToken is a smart contract implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a basic framework for creating, minting, and burning a custom cryptocurrency token.

Description
The MyToken project is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to manage a custom cryptocurrency token. The contract includes public variables to store essential information about the token, such as its name ("SAMPARK"), abbreviation ("SAM"), and total supply. A mapping is used to track the balance of each address. The contract includes two primary functions: mint and burn. The mint function increases the total supply of tokens and adds the specified amount to the balance of a given address. Conversely, the burn function reduces the total supply and the balance of the specified address, ensuring the address has sufficient tokens to burn. This smart contract demonstrates fundamental concepts of token management on the Ethereum blockchain.
